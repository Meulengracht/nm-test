	* Ad Ad-Hoc networking mode support.  In Ad-Hoc mode, we only try to get
		link-local addresses instead of doing DHCP.

	* In the panel applet, there's a new "Create new Wireless Network..." item

	* The panel applet also sticks around now even if NetworkManager dies, but
		it doesn't hide its icon when NM isn't around.  Not hiding the icon is
		a bug, I'll fix that later.

	* We also don't use 'nscd' anymore in the RH backend, it was impeding name
		lookups after a switch rather than actually doing them.

	* Clean up some of those warnings in nm_ap_list_* functions

	* Delay between scans changed to 15s instead of 10s
