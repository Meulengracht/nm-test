	* src/NetworkManagerAP.[ch]
		- Add "artificial" get/set functions, set for APs that
			aren't discovered as part of a scan but instead
			discovered by force-setting the ESSID

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- (nm_device_wireless_network_exists): pass back whether
			or not the discovered AP was encrypted.  Also, try
			falling back to encrypted mode on the card if unencrypted
			association doesn't work
		- (nm_device_find_and_use_essid): If the network requested
			did in fact exists, but it wasn't in our scan list, add
			an "artificial" entry for it.  Some Cisco cards don't
			see non-ESSID-broadcasting APs in their scan but can still
			associate with them if you know the ESSID, this works around
			that behavior
		- (nm_device_do_normal_scan): Carry "artificial" APs over from scan
			to scan if the card is currently associated with that AP
