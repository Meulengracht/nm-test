	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.[ch]
	  info-dameon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.[ch]
	  info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoPassphraseDialog.[ch]
		- Preserve original label text in the passphrase dialog so that
			it actually gets updated with the new network name the next
			time around.  Previously, we were overwriting it so you'd get
			the wrong network name to enter a key for
		- Add a "Key Type" combo to the passphrase dialog, user selects
			encryption key type now, type is stored in GConf too
		- Adjust NM<->NMI DBUS protocol to pass the key type back to NM too

	* src/NetworkManagerAP.[ch]
		- Remove all the encyption method magic.  It's now set by the user
			and NetworkManager retrieves the type of encryption key from
			NetworkManagerInfo

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.[ch]
	  src/NetworkManagerDbus.[ch]
		- Adjust to new way of setting encryption key and method
		- Pull encryption method down from NMI along with key

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- Removed encryption method fallback magic as the method is now
			determined by the user.  This greatly simplifies the connection
			logic.
		- More robust connection/link logic.  Besides removing the encryption
			method fallback magic, check whether or not the card is receiving
			invalidly encrypted packets, which usually indicates that we have
			a bad WEP key set.
		- Don't blindly forge ahead when DHCP fails (still not completely fixed)

	* test/nminfotest.c
		- Test out new "Key Type" stuff in the NMI passphrase dialog
