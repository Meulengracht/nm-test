        * examples/python/NetworkManager.py:
        added CONNECTED, CONNECTING, and DISCONNECTED states
        added methods to return number of devices of a single type

        * examples/python/systray/network_tray.py:
        did some tweaks to get the menu looking near what it is supposed
        to look like.  Also did a Airo card hack to make it show the
        correct AP quality
