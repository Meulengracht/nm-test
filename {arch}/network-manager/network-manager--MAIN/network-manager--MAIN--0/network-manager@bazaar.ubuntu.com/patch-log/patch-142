	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
	  panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
		- Start using NetworkDevice/WirelessNetwork structures in more places
		- Update for unified device/network forcing in NetworkManager

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- some code consolidation

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- (nm_dbus_nm_set_active_device): "setActiveDevice" now takes either one
			or two arguments:  the first is the NM ID of the device to switch to,
			and the second (optional) argument is the ESSID of a wireless network
			to use as well.
		- Get rid of "setNetwork" method due to above change

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_new): perform scan and update best AP on device creation
		- nm_device_activation_cancel_if_needed()->nm_device_activation_should_cancel()
		- nm_device_activation_signal_cancel()->nm_device_activation_cancel(), and
			spin waiting for cancellation to finish before returning

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- Changes here clarify the situations in which a device switch occurs, and
			make sure to keep using a forced device and network if the user gives
			us one
		- Remove old unused code
