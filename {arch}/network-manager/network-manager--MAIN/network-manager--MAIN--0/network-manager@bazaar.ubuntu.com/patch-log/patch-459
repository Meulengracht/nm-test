	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- (nm_policy_activation_finish): Deactivate a device if its activation fails,
			and NULL out data->active_device so that we have to choose another one.
			This may make NetworkManager keep attempting to connect to a wired network
			if it fails, but if it keeps failing the wired network has more problems than
			just NetworkManager.

	* src/backends/NetworkManagerRedHat.c
		- (nm_system_update_dns): fix to actually run nscd -i hosts when nscd
			is already running

	* named/nm-named-manager.c
		- (rewrite_resolv_conf): Call nm_system_update_dns() when not using
			named so that the distro can flush whatever name service caching
			daemon it uses
