	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletOtherNetworkDialog.c,
		- Disable OK button until valid data is entered
			for encryption stuff too

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
		- Report card strength for current AP if the card
			doesn't report strength data for scanned access
			points

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Smooth out cards reported quality, Atmel card was
			intermittently reporting no quality data but soon
			recovers

			cards (mine at least) seem to report the quality
			in percentage format already, so honor that
