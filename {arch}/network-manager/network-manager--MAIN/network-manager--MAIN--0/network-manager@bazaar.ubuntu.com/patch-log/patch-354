	* dhcpcd/client.c
		- Use correct timeout value

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.c
	  src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- Consolidate communication between NM and NMI by doing only 1 dbus
			method call to get Wireless Network info from NMI instead of 6

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- Make sure to cancel activation when we receive a SIGTERM, otherwise
			when we didn't have an AP to use, we'd wait for one forever without
			quitting

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- nm_device_activation_cancel(): Fix a race between dhcp and quitting
			activation, dhcp might not have started yet but we don't quit activation
			before starting it, so the quit signal gets lost
