	* Major rework of the DHCP code, taking some cues from pump.  We don't
		write raw Ethernet packets anymore, which simplifies the code quite
		a bit.  The new code should be more robust, not hang in recvfrom()
		as much, and generally work better.  This also means that we need
		to force HAL/dbus to use a created GMainContext rather than the
		default context, since having the DHCP renew/rebind thread using
		its own GMainContext seemed to give dbus a fit.  There is also more
		debugging information printed from the DHCP loop to help with future
		problems.

	* Also, if the DHCP server doesn't give us the "routersOnSubnet" option,
		assume that the default gateway should be the DHCP server.

	Patch from Matthew Schick <matt oss-institute org>
	* src/backends/NetworkManagerGentoo.c
		- Fix compilation error due to missing "ip4_broadcast"
