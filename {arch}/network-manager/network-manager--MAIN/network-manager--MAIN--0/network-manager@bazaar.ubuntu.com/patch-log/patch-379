	* Cache last-known-good wireless authentication method in
		NetworkManagerInfo, and use that method first during
		wireless device activation.  Should speed up devices that
		need Shared Key authentication method since Open System is
		now the default.

	* Remove the hack to not do full activation on wired connections
		that are active when we launch, it causes too many problems
		with name resolution and was a hack in the first place.

	* Re-work wireless device activation again somewhat to have a
		clearer chain of events and to use last-known-good
		authentication method of the access point.  Also provide
		better status throughout activation to ensure the applet
		can tell the user exactly what's going on.

	* Remove the "find wireless network" code and now simply attempt
		to activate with that access point.  This reduces the delay
		between selecting "Other wireless Network" and actually
		connecting to that network.

	* Correctly stop the device's worker thread when its removed.
