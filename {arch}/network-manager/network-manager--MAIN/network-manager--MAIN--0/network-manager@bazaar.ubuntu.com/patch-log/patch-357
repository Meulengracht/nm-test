	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Implement "auto" frequency/channel support, since cards like Atheros
			can't use other frequencies at all when you've told it to use a
			specific one, even for scanning.
		- Grab the scan mutex around places where we can't tolerate wireless
			settings changing underneath us, like nm_device_wireless_network_exists()
			and nm_device_activate_wireless()

	* src/NetworkManagerWireless.c
		- Back scan interval off to 20s instead of 14s
