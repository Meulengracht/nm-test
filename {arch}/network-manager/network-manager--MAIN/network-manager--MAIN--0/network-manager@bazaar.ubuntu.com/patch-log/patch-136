	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
		- Pull fresh devices and networks from NM when wireless networks
			change.  Provides faster feedback of a forced wireless network

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- Return error when "getMaxQuality" is called on a wired device
		- Make best_ap freezing actually work again, and signal cancellation
			of activation if there's already a device activation when the user
			freezes the best_ap

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Don't clear out the best_ap for wireless devices when the link goes
			down, that's done elsewhere
		- Kill any dhcp daemons when cancelling device activation since they
			may be stuck waiting for a DHCP address, and since we're cancelling
			activation we don't care about that anymore

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- Make sure to unref the device we ref earlier (we refed it to make sure
			it stuck around during device activation and such)
		- If we were going to change the best device, but its activating currently
			(and therefore the change didn't occur due to the check earlier)
			we mark the state changed to we come back to it later when device
			activation has canceled and its no longer activating

	* src/backends/NetworkManagerRedHat.c
		- SIGKILL dhcp daemons rather than SIGTERM-ing them
