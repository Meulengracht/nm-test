        * examples/python/NetworkManager.py:
        added convience functions has_wired_device and has_wireless_device

        * examples/python/systray/network_tray.py:
        cleaned up a bunch of cruft, added support for listing wireless
        networks just like the real applet.  This is probably all I'm
        going to work on this applet from now on.
        TODO: add support for actually changing networks and devices
