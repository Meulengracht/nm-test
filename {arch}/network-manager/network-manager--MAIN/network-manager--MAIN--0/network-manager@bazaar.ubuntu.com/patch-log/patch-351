	* dhcpcd/client.c
		- Rework the DHCP client code to be much less chatty when
			it receives non-DHCP UDP packets during the DHCP run
			(reported by and preliminary patches from Bill Moss)

	* Move wireless scanning to a separate thread.  This thread forwards the
		results to the main thread when done where they are integrated into
		the device's access point lists.  This keeps the main thread (which
		does all the DBUS communication) from being blocked for long periods
		of time by wireless scanning.

	* Make state modification an idle routine in the main loop, and trigger
		state changes rather than polling for them.

	* src/backends/NetworkManagerGentoo.c
		- Fix up invalid C90 code (reported by Christoph Ruessler)

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Revert IPv6 patch for wired devices from 2004-12-22 for
			router advertisements, causing problems and infinite loop
			during "best" device determination due to link going up/down
			(reported by Bill Moss)

	Apply patch from Peter Jones
	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Shortcut for link-checking for ipw2x00 cards
		- Split out association check into separate routine
