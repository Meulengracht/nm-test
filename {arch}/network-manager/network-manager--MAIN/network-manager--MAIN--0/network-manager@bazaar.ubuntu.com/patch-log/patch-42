	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.[ch]
		- Fix up copyright and credits to include Bastien and Eskil,
			who created the gnome-applets wireless applet, from whose
			skeleton this one was created
		- Rework nmwa_update_state()/nmwa_draw() so that state and which
			pixmap to draw is computed during nmwa_update_state()
		- Applet now shows itself all the time due to panel packing issues
			which caused the applet to previously never come back after hiding.
			When a wired device is the active device, the applet shows "not connected"

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.[ch]
		- Clean up error messages and show what function they are from
		- nmwa_dbus_get_active_wireless_device()->nmwa_dbus_get_active_device()
		- Add new device type getters, and a status getter

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- (nm_dbus_devices_handle_request): Don't return an active network unless that
			network is actually in the device's ap list
		- (nm_dbus_nm_message_handler): Fix silly mistake returning status

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_update_best_ap): If the best AP is NULL, clear out the ESSID of the
			card

	* test/nmclienttest.c
		- Report status of NetworkManager too
